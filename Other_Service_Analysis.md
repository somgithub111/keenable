|`8`|**Incident Analysis & Resolution** |AC Compressor was not running properly and only fan was working due to which cooling is affected.Old Capacitor was replaced as inaccurate power factor in circuit was detected using multimeter. Expansion valve is cleared through jet pipe cleaning to avoid blockage. The Root cause for the missing cool burst was detected as Voltage output issue experienced by Main Stabilizer connected to the Electricity source and the issue is resolved successfully with Stabilizer voltage I/O cutoff reconfiguration, which further helped the compressor to work properly.|
